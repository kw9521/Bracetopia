[insert your answers after the question and add more lines as needed.]

[PLEASE MAKE YOUR ANSWERS SHORT AND TO THE POINT. BULLET POINTS ARE GOOD.]

============= PROGRAM STATUS ==============

What is the status of the program?
Does it: put an X inside the [] to characterize your answer
	[ ] crashes
	[ ] infinite loops when it should not
	[ ] works only in 'print' mode
	[X] works fine
	[ ] only implemented these options: [list them below]
	[ ] other. Explain below.


How does your move algorithm work? Describe briefly in English.

	1. Goes thru entire 2D array
	2. Makes an int array to keep track of which cells CAN and CANT be moved using 0,1,2 based on their happiness calcualtion
	(tried using * like the write up but didn't work really well so I changed it to 0,1,2)
	3. If cell is a 1, it CAN be moved and will be moved to the next avaliable empty spot (denoted by 0 in that int array)
	4. Swaps spots 
	3b. If cell is a 1 and no spot is left, it returns the # of moves made so far
	5. Check if current command line argument is in PRINT mode or not
	5a. If in print mode, prints out data regularly
	5b. Otherwise just returns the # of moves made in current cycle

============= SIMULATION ANALYSIS ==============

What did you find most revealing about the simulation?

	That the write up results are not accurate.


============= GENERAL PROJECT FEEDBACK ==============

What did I learn?

	That I should name my variables better, try not to have functions that ask for so many parameters. 

What was easy about this assignment?

	Literally nothing

What gave you problems or troubles?

	Literally everything

What should the instructor do to improve this assignment?

	Update the expect results so we can test our code instead of us just guessing if our results are right or not. 
	Instructors should also clarify how they wanted us to calculate certain stuff like happiness, # of vacs, # of endlines, etc

What would you have liked to do in this assignment?

	I have no opinion on this.
